    <h1>Topic Proposal</h1>
    <section id="Problem Description">
        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>

        <h3>Topic Overview</h3>
        <p>COVID-19 has become quite a serious issue in the past few months,
            and there is a lot of information that is necessary for people to
            be prepared and respond to it that is not as easily availible as it
            should be. Therefore, it is necessary to collect and analyze more
            information so people, researchrs, and government officials can respond
            to the crisis.
        </p>

        <h3>Information Technology Problem</h3>
        <p>How can we use data to demonstrate the way that COVID-19 cases have increased
            across the different states in the United States?
        </p>

        <h3>Past Solutions to this Problem</h3>
        <p>
            Past solutions for showcasing the distrubution of COVID-19 cases in the United
            States include several distrubution maps made by newspapers like the New York Times.
            Additionally, state governments provide regularly updated statistics on the number of
            confirmed COVID-19 cases and casulties.
        </p>

        <h3>Users</h3>
        <p>
            The users of this application will be anyone who is interested in learning more about
            the spread of COVID-19 across the United States. This well help these people get a better
            understanding of how COVID-19 has impacted their location over time, and understand the state-
            wide distribution of COVID-19 cases.
        </p>

        <h3>Information Sources</h3>
        <p>For this application, I will draw on data in a .CSV file from the New York Times' COVID-19 case
            count article. This dataset includes statistics on the number of confirmed cases, casulties, and tests
            excecuted in the United States. This will give me the data to generate interactive state-based graphics
            that the users can explore to get a better understanding of the distrubtion of COVID-19 in their state over
            time.
        </p>

        <h3>UI</h3>
        <p>The primary interactions that the users will be able to explore are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                View COVID-19 data according to different states
            </li>
            <li>
                View COVID-19 data over a selected timeframe
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            This application will solve a problem by providing more accessible and interactive
            information about COVID-19 cases in individual states of the United States, which will
            help provide a better understanding of how COVID-19 has impacted states over time.
        </p>

        <h3>Team Partners</h3>
        <p>
            I would like to work with Locksley Kolakowski on this project.
